1) making process
	-the system has a premade set of funcions to help speedUp the process of making hoverCrafts. thes funcions are binded to buttons, shown at the bottom of the hoverCraft script.


2) problems
	-if something doesn't work try usings 2 lowest setup funcions in the hoverCraft script (thy are there to show you what works).

	-if you have problens with tghe hoverCraft tilting due to rigidbodies on it (like if you have a hevy box on the hoverCraft) try seting the drag and angularDrag to higher values.

	-if the hoverCraft is spinnig or tilting (not due to rigidbodies on it) make sure that hoverPoints are 100% simetrical to the center Transform, which is at the vehicles center;

	-if the hoverCraft touches the ground try:
		a) set liftForce and hoverHeight to a higher value;
		b) put hoverPoints further from veicle, and/or add more hoverPoints.

	-in case of question or problems please feel free to leave a review of the asset on asset store or e-mail me (adress given at assets page).
